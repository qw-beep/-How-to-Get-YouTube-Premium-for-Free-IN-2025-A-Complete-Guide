### 3. **Student Discount on YouTube Premium**

If youâ€™re a student, you can get YouTube Premium at a discounted price of just $6.99 per month instead of the standard $11.99. While this isnâ€™t technically free, itâ€™s a great way to save money while enjoying all the benefits of YouTube Premium.

### 4. **Sharing YouTube Premium with Family**

YouTube Premium offers a family plan that allows you to share your subscription with up to 5 other people (6 total). If you have a family member or friend with YouTube Premium, you might be able to get access to their account for free.

#### How to Get YouTube Premium through Family Sharing:
1. Ask a family member who already has YouTube Premium if they can add you to their family plan.
2. Once they add you, youâ€™ll get access to YouTube Premium for free as long as they continue paying for the subscription.

This method is great for those who have family members with YouTube Premium but donâ€™t want to pay for the service themselves.

2. Look for **seasonal promotions** or **special deals** that offer free trials or discounts.
3. Sign up for YouTube Premium during the promotional period to get free access or discounts.

Promotions can be a great way to access YouTube Premium for free or at a fraction of the regular price.

### 6. **Accessing YouTube Premium via T-Mobile or Other Carriers**

Some mobile carriers, such as T-Mobile, offer YouTube Premium as part of their plans. If youâ€™re already a customer of one of these carriers, you may be able to get YouTube Premium for free as part of your mobile plan.

#### How to Check if Your Carrier Offers YouTube Premium:

This is an excellent option for those already subscribing to mobile plans that include this perk.
